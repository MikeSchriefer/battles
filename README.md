Capstone Proposal

Data: CBD90 dataset containing all available information on military battles from 1600-1973

Motivation: I spent 9+ years as an infantryman, spending time as an instructor of small unit tactics. I’m interested to see if some of the broader concepts and most commonly held beliefs about warfare are supported by the data.

Data Question(s): 
Is there a certain combination of categorical advantages that gives an attacker an insurmountable advantage/disadvantage? 
What is the most important categorical advantage? What is the least important?
 Are there relatively new/recent technologies that have changed the ratio of advantages that constitutes a ‘sure thing’? Does a ‘sure thing’ exist at all?

Known Issues/Challenges: 
The data will need to be ‘put together’. There are a number of ‘main’ tables, as well as several ‘lookup’ tables with information for the former.
The data does not include any information past 1973 -- can I find some elsewhere?
It may prove to be challenging to identify trends on the earlier, less complete data.
