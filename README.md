Capstone Proposal

Data: CBD90 dataset containing all available information on military battles from 1600-1973

Motivation: I spent 9+ years as an infantryman, spending time as an instructor of small unit tactics. I’m interested to see if some of the broader concepts and most commonly held beliefs about warfare are supported by the data.

Data Question(s): 
Is there a certain combination of categorical advantages that gives an attacker an insurmountable advantage/disadvantage? 
What is the most important categorical advantage? What is the least important?
 Are there relatively new/recent technologies that have changed the ratio of advantages that constitutes a ‘sure thing’? Does a ‘sure thing’ exist at all?

I answered these questions, and created tools to help navigate the CDB90 dataset. The presentation can be found on Tableau Public by clicking the link below.
